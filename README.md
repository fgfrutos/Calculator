# Calculator

This project is an attempt to clone the iphone calculator as a final project of [The Oding Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) (foundations) curriculum. It is created with HTLM, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

Throughout this project I have learned quite a few things:

1. How to use CSS in a more or less decent way
2. How math works with decimal numbers in JavaScript.
3. That it is preferable to think well about the design and functionalities of the program before starting with the code (it saves a lot of time) and that it is better to have many commits than to have too few. 

The code is not optimally organized, and surely there were easier ways to create a system with the same functionalities as the one I just created. But, I must say that I'm very happy with the result, and I'm looking forward to continue learning about web development!

Here you can find a [live demo](https://fgfrutos.github.io/Calculator/) of the project.

Enjoy it!
